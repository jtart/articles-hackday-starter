        			<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>

        			<p>The fire was reported at the 24-storey block in North Kensington at 00:54 BST (23:54 GMT), leading to 40 fire engines and more than 200 firefighters tackling the blaze.</p>

        			<p>It took until 01:14 BST the following day to get it under control, with the fire affecting most floors of the building and destroying 151 homes, both in the tower and surrounding areas.</p>

        			<p>The Metropolitan Police says it will consider manslaughter, health and safety and fire safety charges.</p>
