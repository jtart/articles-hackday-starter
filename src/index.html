				<h1 class="title font-weight-bold mb-3">Trump 'compromising' claims: How and why did we get here?</h1>

				<p class="font-weight-bold">Donald Trump has described as "fake news" allegations published in some media that his election team colluded with Russia - and that Russia held compromising material about his private life.</p>
				
				<p>The significance of these allegations is that, if true, the president-elect of the United States would be vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians.
				I understand the CIA believes it is credible that the Kremlin has such kompromat - or compromising material - on the next US commander in chief. At the same time a joint taskforce, which includes the CIA and the FBI, has been investigating allegations that the Russians may have sent money to Mr Trump's organisation or his election campaign.</p>

				<p>Claims about a Russian blackmail tape were made in one of a series of reports written by a former British intelligence agent, understood to be Christopher Steele.
				As a member of MI6, he had been posted to the UK's embassy in Moscow and now runs a consultancy giving advice on doing business in Russia. He spoke to a number of his old contacts in the FSB, the successor to the KGB, paying some of them for information.</p>

				<p>They told him that Mr Trump had been filmed with a group of prostitutes in the presidential suite of Moscow's Ritz-Carlton hotel. I know this because the Washington political research company that commissioned his report showed it to me during the final week of the election campaign.</p>

				<p>The BBC decided not to use it then, for the very good reason that without seeing the tape - if it exists - we could not know if the claims were true. The detail of the allegations were certainly lurid. The entire series of reports has now been posted by BuzzFeed.</p>

				<p>Mr Trump's supporters say this is a politically motivated attack. </p>

				<p>The president-elect himself, outraged, tweeted this morning: "Are we living in Nazi Germany?" </p>

				<p>Later, at his much-awaited news conference, he was unrestrained.</p>

				<p>"A thing like that should have never been written," he said, "and certainly should never have been released."</p>

				<p>He said the memo was written by "sick people [who] put that crap together". </p>

				<p>The opposition research firm that commissioned the report had worked first for an anti-Trump superpac - political action committee - during the Republican primaries. </p>

				<p>Then during the general election, it was funded by an anonymous Democratic Party supporter. But these are not political hacks - their usual line of work is country analysis and commercial risk assessment, similar to the former MI6 agent's consultancy. He, apparently, gave his dossier to the FBI against the firm's advice.</p>

				<p><a href="/">How did Trump 'compromise' claims come to light?</a></p>

				<p>And the former MI6 agent is not the only source for the claim about Russian kompromat on the president-elect. Back in August, a retired spy told me he had been informed of its existence by "the head of an East European intelligence agency".</p>
				
				<p>Later, I used an intermediary to pass some questions to active duty CIA officers dealing with the case file - they would not speak to me directly. I got a message back that there was "more than one tape", "audio and video", on "more than one date", in "more than one place" - in the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow and also in St Petersburg - and that the material was "of a sexual nature".</p>
